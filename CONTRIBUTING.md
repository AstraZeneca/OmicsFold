# Contributing to InterFold

We welcome contributions to InterFold from the community.  If you have changes
you wish to make, it would be worth [contacting the maintainers](AUTHORS.md)
first to ensure it aligns with their roadmap for InterFold.  When you are ready
to proceed, make a Fork of the repository, create a new branch and push your
changes onto it.  When you are ready to submit your changes, open a Pull Request
back to the main repository and the maintainers will review your changes.  We
have tried to stick to [good R coding
standards](https://jef.works/R-style-guide/) so please don't be offended if we
ask you to meet those standards with your own contributions before they can be
merged in.  In fact if you notice that we haven't met the standards, feel free
to submit a Pull Request cleaning up the code to meet the standards.

Don't forget to add your name to the relevant author lists as part of your
contribution.
